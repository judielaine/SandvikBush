## Physics

- [MSU Phy820 Physics & Jupyter](https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~hergert/phy820/computation/python/) I've included the demo notebook and added some links from their page below.
- [Programming for Aspiring Rocketeers](http://physics.stmarys-ca.edu/faculty/brianhill/courses/Jan033/20J/index.html) Note the snide comment about a licensed profession leading that profession to becoming moribund is demonstrably false: architecture and restauraunts offer satisfactory counter examples. I forked a copy of the [github repository](https://github.com/judielaine/loops-and-orbits) for our own exploration.

## Libraries

- Python software libraries: Libraries provide extra functions to a software language: expansion packs. You have to explicitly add the libraries to use the additional functions. 
  - These should be included in the anaconda installation. (This text copied from the MSU Phy820 page.)
    - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) ([PDF list of commands](https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~hergert/phy820/computation/python/pdfs/Matplotlib-Python_cheatsheets_Datacamp.pdf)): Matplotlib is one of the most popular libraries for plotting in Python. Use it in your Jupyter notebooks.
      - Yan, Holtz. “Matplotlib.” Tutorials and coding resources. The Python Graph Gallery (blog), June 24, 2017. [https://python-graph-gallery.com/matplotlib/](xhttps://python-graph-gallery.com/matplotlib/).
    - [SciPy](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/index.html) ([PDF list of commands](https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~hergert/phy820/computation/python/pdfs/SciPy_Linear_Algebra-Python_cheatsheets_Datacamp.pdf)): Python’s collection of routines for scientific computing (special functions, linear algebra etc.). Interfaces with NumPy for efficiency.
    - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)([PDF list of commands](https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~hergert/phy820/computation/python/pdfs/NumPy_Basics-Python_cheatsheets_Datacamp.pdf)): NumPy, and in particular the NumPy data structures, are used for efficient numerical computation in Python. NumPy provides wrappers for many highly optimized numerical libraries, allowing you to exploit features like parallelization from your Python code - today, there are high-performance applications running on supercomputers that are written in Python, using NumPy for their numerical heavy lifting!
  
  - [Physical units: pint](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2019/8/19/x-lines-of-python-physical-units): _I haven't played with this yet myself. Could be interesting._
