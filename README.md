This project is for W & Judielaine to share files.

You can look at a jupyter notebook without installing anything by going to [this page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/judielaine/SandvikBush/blob/main/Our%20first%20joint%20notebook.ipynb), which i created by going to [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and entering in the URL for the view of the github view of "Our first joint notebook.ipynb". To run the notebook from the notebook viewer, click the icon in the upper right of three rings, "run on binder". It may "take longer than usual to start"



## To Do

- [ ] Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) "64-Bit Graphical Installer (435 MB)"
  - This adds the python language and the software to use python in a jupyter notebook. You can open the anaconda navigator application and click on the "Launch" button to start jupyter notebooks. If we need to add more software, we can do it using the "Environments" tab.
- [ ] Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  - We can share notes and comments and notebooks using github, a place where people share code.
- [ ] [Join github](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)
  - This will allow you to put code in the repository we will share.
- [ ] (optional) Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
  - This is a great editor for code. It might be something to install later or there may be something you are using that is good enough.
